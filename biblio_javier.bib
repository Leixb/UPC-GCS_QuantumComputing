*One technical note: At 1:30 I claim that lattices are composed only of integers. This is not true. Some lattices only contain integers, but in general, any rational number will do.},

	abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography is the generic term for constructions of cryptographic primitives that involve lattices, either in the construction itself or in the security proof. Lattice-based constructions are currently important candidates for post-quantum cryptography.  Unlike more widely used and known public-key schemes such as the {RSA}, Diffie-Hellman or elliptic-curve cryptosystems, which could, theoretically, be easily attacked by a quantum computer, some lattice-based constructions appear to be resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers. Furthermore, many lattice-based constructions are considered to be secure under the assumption that certain well-studied computational lattice problems cannot be solved efficiently.},

	abstract = {The {NTRUEncrypt} public key cryptosystem, also known as the {NTRU} encryption algorithm, is a lattice-based alternative to {RSA} and {ECC} and is based on the shortest vector problem in a lattice (which is not known to be breakable using quantum computers).
It relies on the presumed difficulty of factoring certain polynomials in a truncated polynomial ring into a quotient of two polynomials having very small coefficients.  Breaking the cryptosystem is strongly related, though not equivalent, to the algorithmic problem of lattice reduction in certain lattices. Careful choice of parameters is necessary to thwart some published attacks.
Since both encryption and decryption use only simple polynomial multiplication, these operations are very fast compared to other asymmetric encryption schemes, such as {RSA}, {ElGamal} and elliptic curve cryptography. However, {NTRUEncrypt} has not yet undergone a comparable amount of cryptographic analysis in deployed form.
A related algorithm is the {NTRUSign} digital signature algorithm.
Specifically, {NTRU} operations are based on objects in a truncated polynomial ring
