	abstract = {We give precise quantum resource estimates for Shor's algorithm to compute discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields. The estimates are derived from a simulation of a Toffoli gate network for controlled elliptic curve point addition, implemented within the framework of the quantum computing software tool suite {LIQ}\$Ui{\textbar}{\textbackslash}rangle\$. We determine circuit implementations for reversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and inversion, as well as reversible elliptic curve point addition. We conclude that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an \$n\$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most \$9n + 2{\textbackslash}lceil{\textbackslash}log\_2(n){\textbackslash}rceil+10\$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most \$448 n{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}log\_2(n) + 4090 n{\textasciicircum}3\$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the Toffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition as the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the {NIST} standard curves P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to recent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also support estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking {RSA}, suggesting that indeed {ECC} is an easier target than {RSA}.},

	abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time of at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

	abstract = {A multivariate public key cryptosystem ({MPKCs} for short) have a set of (usually) quadratic polynomials over a finite field as its public map. Its main security assumption is backed by the {NP}-hardness of the problem to solve nonlinear equations over a finite field. This family is considered as one of the major families of {PKCs} that could resist potentially even the powerful quantum computers of the future. There has been fast and intensive development in Multivariate Public Key Cryptography in the last two decades. Some constructions are not as secure as was claimed initially, but others are still viable. The paper gives an overview of multivariate public key cryptography and discusses the current status of the research in this area.},

Till 1920, elliptic curves were studied mainly by Cauchy, Lucas, Sylvester, Poincare. In 1984, Lenstra used elliptic curves for factoring integers and that was the first use of elliptic curves in cryptography. Fermat’s Last theorem and General Reciprocity Law was proved using elliptic curves and that is how elliptic curves became the centre of attraction for many mathematicians.},

Accessible, compelling, and remarkably far-reaching, this book will forever alter your view of history and what drives it.  It will also make you wonder how private that e-mail you just sent really is.},
